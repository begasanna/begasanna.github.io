         <div id="tab1">Welcome to Ukraine! Ukraine is a picturesque country,
            which is situated in the south-western part of Europe. It is washed
            by two seas: the Black sea and the Sea of Azov. The land of Ukraine
            varies from forests and high mountains to valleys and steppes. But
            each part of Ukraine has a unique charm of its-own. There are a lot
             rivers and lakes in different parts of the country, such as the Southern Buh,
            the Dniester, the Desna, the Siversky Donets, and others. They also contribute
            to its beauty. The main river in Ukraine is the Dnieper, the third longest river
            in Europe which divides Ukraine into the Right Bank and the Left-Bank territories.</div>
         <div id="tab2">The history of Great Britain is long and interesting. The first human
           inhabitants of Britain appeared on its territory already in prehistoric times. The
           hunters of the Neolithic Age (New Stone Age) crossed the sea to Britain. They settled
           on its shores in their search for food. Soon after 700 ВС Britain was occupied by the Celts.
Their language developed into the Celtic language of modern Wales. In AD 43 the Romans began an invasion.
 It resulted in the Roman occupation of Britain. The Romans built many towns. The largest of the towns
 was called Londinium. It was on the river Thames, where London is today. It became the capital city.
In the 5th century Britain was attacked by the Germanic tribes of the Jutes, the Saxons, and the Angles.
 The invaders settled down and formed a number of small kingdoms. The Anglo-Saxons and Jutes gradually
 became one people. In the 7th — 9th centuries important changes took place in the Anglo-Saxons communities.
  Land became private property of separate families. It was the beginning of feudal relations. The Danish
  invasions of the 9th and 10th centuries brought a new wave of the development of feudal relations in England.
  At the beginning of the 9th century the Danes and Norsemen began to occupy the country. In the 11th century
  the invasion by the Normans under William the Conqueror began.</div>
         <div id="tab3">The United States does not have a national system of education. Education considered
            to be a matter for the people of each state. Although there is a federal Department of Education,
             its function is merely to gather information, to advise, and to help finance certain educational
             programs. Education, Americans say is "a national concern, a state responsibility, and a local function".
According to the most recent data from the National Center for Education Statistics, 69 percent of U.S. students
who complete secondary education go directly to a degree-granting university. Student enrollment in degree-granting
 two-and four-year postsecondary U.S. institutions has more than doubled since 1970 from just over 7 million to almost
 15 million in 2005. But the 1970s saw other major changes in U.S. institutions of higher education.
Since 1970, women's undergraduate enrollment has increased more than three times as quickly as men's. Actually,
 it surpassed men's enrollment in 1978. Women made up 42 percent of undergraduate enrollment in 1970, some 50
  percent in 1977 and 57 percent in 2005. Experts expect women's undergraduate enrollment to continue growing
   more quickly than men's enrollment and to make up 60 percent of enrollment in 2016.</div>
